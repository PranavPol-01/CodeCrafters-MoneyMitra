                <li>
                  <strong>Legal Reduction of Taxes:</strong> Tax planning allows
                  you to take advantage of various deductions, exemptions, and
                  tax-saving instruments provided by the government. By
                  strategically utilizing these provisions, you can reduce your
                  taxable income and, consequently, the amount of tax you owe.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Effective Use of Tax Credits:</strong> Tax credits,
                  such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the United
                  States, can directly reduce your tax liability. Proper tax
                  planning ensures you qualify for these credits and claim them
                  effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Income Splitting:</strong> In some cases, you can
                  allocate income among family members or legal entities to take
                  advantage of lower tax brackets or exemptions. This strategy,
                  often used in businesses and estate planning, can lead to
                  substantial tax savings.
