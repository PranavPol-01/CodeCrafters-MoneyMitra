            India offers several tax-saving investment options under Section 80C
            of the Income Tax Act. These investments not only help you save
            taxes but also provide avenues for wealth creation over time. Here
            are some key tax-saving instruments:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mt-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Public Provident Fund (PPF):</strong> PPF is a long-term
              savings scheme that offers tax benefits. Contributions to PPF are
              eligible for a deduction of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh per year under
              Section 80C. The interest earned and the final maturity amount are
              tax-free.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Employee Provident Fund (EPF):</strong> EPF is a mandatory
              retirement savings scheme for salaried employees. Both your and
              your employer's contributions to EPF are eligible for tax benefits
              under Section 80C.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>National Savings Certificate (NSC):</strong> NSC is a
              fixed-income investment with a lock-in period of 5 years. The
              interest earned is taxable, but the initial investment qualifies
              for a Section 80C deduction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tax-Saving Fixed Deposits:</strong> Many banks offer
              tax-saving fixed deposits with a lock-in period of 5 years. The
              interest earned on these deposits is taxable, but the principal
              amount is eligible for a Section 80C deduction.

              <strong>Section 80CCD(1):</strong> You can claim deductions of up
              to 10% of your salary (for salaried individuals) or 20% of your

            NPS provides an opportunity to build a retirement corpus while
            enjoying tax benefits. It allows you to choose between equity
            (higher risk) and debt (lower risk) investments based on your risk
            tolerance and retirement goals.

            Keep in mind that tax laws can change, so it's essential to stay
            updated and consider consulting a tax advisor or financial planner
            to create a customized tax-saving plan that aligns with your
            financial goals and takes advantage of the latest tax-saving
