            Income Tax Return (ITR) documents differ as per the earning sources
            of the tax filer. But, certain documents are mandatory for every
            taxpayer, irrespective of income sources. Here is a list of such
            common ITR documents that are required to file ITR in FY 2022-23 (AY
            2023-24).

            <li>
              This is the first and foremost prerequisite if you are filing an
              income tax return. PAN is also required to deduct TDS and should
              be linked with your bank account for direct credit of income tax
              refund (if any). It is issued by the Income Tax Department, and a
              salaried employee can find the PAN number either on a PAN card,
              Form 26AS, Form 16, Form 12BB, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, as per the recent amendment by the Govt, taxpayers can
              also file the ITR with their Aadhaar number instead of their PAN
              number.

              According to Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act, individuals
              need to provide his/her Aadhaar card details while filing the
              returns.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you do not have your Aadhaar card but have applied for the

            <li>
              Linking PAN and Aadhar helps in verifying your income tax return

            <li>
              UIDAI issues Aadhar card. In case you have lost it or couldn’t
